Keeping time and understanding passage time can be important in running a campaign and having a rule of how long certain take to achieve intended outcomes can be set by the following terms in the World Without Numbers.

For the most cases, WWN recommend GM to have a calendar on hand to track time.
# Scene
- A general even or activity that last no more than 15 minutes.
# Turn
- A 10 minute segment of time can include a scene
