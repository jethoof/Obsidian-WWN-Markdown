## Rounds, Initiative and Surprise
### Rounds
A single timed unit in a combat, roughly **6 seconds**.
### Initiative 
The initiative determines the order of action among different groups. Once the order of the groups are determined, the order within the group can be determined among the actors. 
> [!error] Initiative
> 1d8 + Highest Dexterity Modifier in the Group
> 

> [!tip] GM Tip
> NPCs usually have no modifer.

Individual Initiative [Optional Rule]
Each actor can roll their own initiative to determine the order.
### Surprise
When one group of actors ambush, the ambushed group has a surprise round before the Initiatives are determined. In order for Surprise to succeed, opposed Dex/Sneak versus Wis/Notice check and the ambusher group has to win.

## Actions in Combat
### Main Action
Main focus of the actor's action during the actor's round. An actor has one Main Action every round. 
### Move Action
Any action actor can take during the round. An actor has one Move Action per round, however they can convert their Main Action into a Move Action.
### On Turn Action
mundane actions that requires very little to no effort and time to act on, such examples are, falling prone, readying a weapon, saying few words. An actor has one On Turn Actions per round.
### Instant Action
A quick and simple action actors can use at any time with no real limit its uses during the round. These actions are usually reserved for special powers and abilities.
GM: If there are multiple Instant Actions are triggered, resolve them in an order you deem reasonable.
## Attacking a Foe
When an actor wants to harm another, they need to make a hit roll. An attack usually counts as a Main Action and the attacker must be close enough to actually hit the target with weapon of the attacker's choice.
