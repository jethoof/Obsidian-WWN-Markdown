# Saving Throws
A probability of a hero avoiding harm during a [[Scenes Turns and Durations|scene]]. The typical method to calculate a save is the 16 - hero's level + Mod.
## Evasion Save
Examples: avoid falling rocks and anything related to reaction speed to perils. 

> 16 - Hero's Level + Int/Dex Mod (whichever is higher)

## Mental Saves
Examples: resist mind-affecting magic, see through illusions or test willpower of a hero.

> 16 - Hero's Level + Wis/Cha Mod (whichever is higher)

## Physical Saves 
Examples: resist physical exhaustion, stress or fight off against poison and diseases. 

> 16 - Hero's Level + Str/Con Mod (whichever is higher)

## Luck Saves 
Examples: a blind luck that is not within the control of the character.

> 16 - Hero's Level
